# Bootstrap Overview

**Bootstrap** is an *open-source framework* used to design and develop user interfaces for websites **quickly** and **efficiently**. It is based on `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, offering a wide range of pre-built components such as **buttons**, **forms**, **tables**, and **menus**.  

Bootstrap also includes a *responsive grid system* that helps create websites that adapt **seamlessly** to all screen sizes, including desktops and mobile devices. It aims to simplify the development process by providing **ready-to-use**, *customizable designs*.
